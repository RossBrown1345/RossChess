### TO DO:

~~ make chosen piece move to new destination ~~

~~then hang fire on GUI, work on possible moves for each piece~~

# known problems:




# possible moves for

~~pawns~~
~~horses~~
~~bishops~~
~~rooks~~
~~queens~~
~~kings~~

~~return to GUI to allow for selection of pieces and highlighting possible moves~~

~~allow pieces to be moved with clicks~~


~~gameplay loop~~

~~score keeping~~

~~check when game over~~


### king in check
x bases to cover

must move out of check if in check

must not move into check,

other piece can block check



# check all moves for all opp pieces, and see if king location is present

or

# make minimax first, test a depth one, and if move is king location (same thing  as first option, likely more efficient )




castling
promotion
en passant



make main menu for pvp or pvJoshua
